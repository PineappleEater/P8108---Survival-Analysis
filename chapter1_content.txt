Pre-requisites: P6103, P6104, or the Quant core module; at least one course in probability and 
statistical inference. 
Basic expectation is that students should have:
•Strong quantitative skills
•Basic understanding of probability and statistical inference (common probability density  
functions like binomial, Poisson, normal, hypothesis testing and conﬁdence interv als)
•Understanding of maximum likelihood estimation
•Familiarity with regression approaches for discrete data (eg., logistic regression) and/
or continuous data (eg., linear regression).
Two packets of review notes have been posted on the course website (Modules/
Background and Review Materials) for you:
•Discrete data and random variables
•Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Asymptotic Test Statistics

Course Policy Regarding Use of Generative Intelligence (AI)
Permitted in this Course with Attribution.In this course, students are encouraged to use Generative AI Tools like ChatGPT to support their 
work. To maintain academic integrity, students must disclose any AI-generated material they use and properly attribute it, including in-text citations, quotations, and references.
A student should include the following statement in assignments to indicate use of a Generative 
AI Tool: “The author(s) would like to acknowledge the use of [ Generative AI Tool Name], a 
language model developed by [Generative AI Tool Provider], in the preparation of [Specific Sections and Tasks] in this assignment. The [Generative AI Tool Name] was used in the following way(s) in this assignment [e.g., brainstorming, grammatical correction, citation, which portion of the assignment].”
•Where the use of AI is permitted, you should stick to the guidelines provided by theinstructor. Under no circumstance can you submit any work generated by an AI program asyour own. AI generated material should be cited like any other reference material using theAPA or MLA guidelines.
•If unsure about policies on using generative AI, clarify with the course instructor or yourTA.

8 CHAPTER 1. SURVIVAL ANALYSIS - INTRODUCTION
1.1Course Focus
“Survival Analysis” typically focuses on time to event data. I nt h em o s tg e n e r a l
sense, it consists of techniques for positive-valued random variables, such as:
•time to death
•time to onset (or relapse) of a disease, time to pregnancy
•length of stay in a hospital
•time to bankruptcy
•time to ﬁnishing a doctoral dissertation . . .
•time from ﬁrst submission of a paper to publication . . .
1.1.COURSE FOCUS 9
An example:
Cassileth et al, NEJM, 1998
10 CHAPTER 1. SURVIVAL ANALYSIS - INTRODUCTION
Another Example: The table below shows results comparing the number of
failures (deaths or progression) among cancer patients randomized to a standard
treatment (called “CHOP”) as compared to CHOP with an extra medication,
called rituximab ( Haberman et al, JCO 2006 )
Maintenance
 Number of failures ( Y)
Treatment ( X)
 Yes No
 Total
CHOP+rituximab
 52 (30%) 122
 174
CHOP (standard)
 74 (42%) 104
 178
Total
 126 (36%) 226
 352
The percentage of patients who failed was lower (30%) for those on the extra
medication (CHOP + rituximab) as compared to the standard treatment (42%)
(p=0.03 by Fisher’s exact test)
1.1.COURSE FOCUS 11
However, not only was there a higher percentage of failures on the standard
treatment - the failures also tended to occur earlier:
We can see this if we view the results in a diﬀerent way:
Maintenance
 Number of failures
Treatment
 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Years 4-6
 Total
CHOP+rituximab (N=174)
 26 12 12 2
 52
CHOP (standard) (N=178)
 53 13 6 2
 74
Total
 79 25 18 4
 126
Of the patients who failed:
•50% (26/52) on the CHOP+ arm failed in the ﬁrst year
•72% (53/74) on the standard treatment failed in the ﬁrst year
⇒The timing of failures is diﬀerent on the two arms
Therefore, combining the binary endpoint of failure and the time of the event
into a survival endpoint is more informative
There can also be situations where the percent meeting endpoints is similar, but
the timing is diﬀerent. Survival analysis may be a more powerful approach for
comparing treatment eﬀects.
12 CHAPTER 1. SURVIVAL ANALYSIS - INTRODUCTION
Ahypothetical example:
Say we have 10 subjects assigned to each of four treatments aft er cancer remission,
and we follow them until death or end of study (at 36 months). The times below
are their times to death (in months).
Treatment 1:
 Deaths at: 2, 3, 7, 9, 15, 16 (4 alive at 36 months)
Treatment 2:
 Deaths at 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11 (1 alive at 36 months)
Treatment 3:
 Deaths at 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5 (4 alive at 36 months)
Treatment 4:
 Deaths at: 2, 3, 7, 9, 15, 22, 27, 28, 29 (1 alive at 36 months)
Questions:
•Looking just at Treatment 1, what is the average time to death?
•Comparing Trt 1 and 2, which treatment appears better?
•Comparing Trt 1 and 3, which treatment appears better?
•Comparing Trt 3 and 4, which appears better?
•Are any pairs of treatments “signiﬁcantly” diﬀerent?

14 CHAPTER 1. SURVIVAL ANALYSIS - INTRODUCTION
Although this is a very small example, it illustrates some key principles of survival
data:
•Survival times are often “skewed”, so the median is usually a better measure
of “average” than the mean
•Calculating summary statistics and comparing survival distributions needs to
account for those without events
•Comparisons between survival distributions may give you diﬀerent conclusions
depending on what assumptions you make

16 CHAPTER 1. SURVIVAL ANALYSIS - INTRODUCTION

1.1.COURSE FOCUS 17
Types of survival studies
•clinical trials
•prospective cohort studies
•retrospective cohort studies
Important feature requiring special analysis methods:
Most often, survival data are not fully observed, but rather a recensored .
Weo n l yg e tt oo b s e r v et h es u r v i v a le x p e r i e n c eu pt oac e r t a i nt i m e .
The fact that we are missing part of our variable of interest poses some funda-
mental problems:
•what information do we have?
•what untestable assumptions do we need to make - given the nature of the
missing data - to learn more.
Even under standard (comforting) assumptions, censoring complicates analysis.
18 CHAPTER 1. SURVIVAL ANALYSIS - INTRODUCTION
Next tasks (also see Syllabus):
•further develop the assumption of non-informative censoring
•review probability distributions commonly used with survival outcomes
•describe survival data numerically and graphically
•compare survival of several groups
•explain and predict survival using baseline and time-varying covariates
•design studies with survival endpoints
•analyze multiple survival outcomes, including recurrence or competing risks
